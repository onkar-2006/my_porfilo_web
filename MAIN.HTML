                <h3>potato_disease_prediction</h3>
                <p>Potato is one of the most important crops worldwide, and its productivity can be affected by various diseases, including leaf diseases. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of leaf diseases can help prevent their spread and minimize crop losses. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in image classification tasks, including disease detection in plants. In this study, we propose a CNN-based approach for the prediction of potato leaf diseases. The proposed method uses a pre-trained CNN model, which is fine-tuned on a dataset of potato leaf images. The dataset includes images of healthy leaves and leaves infected with different diseases such as early blight and late blight. The trained model is then used to classify new images of potato leaves into healthy or diseased categories. </p>

                <p>Spam detection is the process of identifying and categorizing unwanted messages, like spam emails, as spam or not spam. The goal is to keep users' inboxes free of potentially harmful information. by using the Natural language processing build a model that classify the given mail is spam or not </p>

                <p>Churn prediction is the process of analyzing customer behavior to predict which customers are likely to stop using a product or service. It's important for businesses because acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. by the help of Artificial Neural Network taking 95% accuracy </p>

                <p>ock price analysis has been a critical area of research and is one of the top applications of machine learning. This tutorial will teach you how to perform stock price prediction using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Here, you will use an LSTM network to train your model with Google stocks data.</p>
